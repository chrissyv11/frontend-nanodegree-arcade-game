===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

In order to run the game, open the index.html file. Other files needed are the app.js, engine.js, resources.js, styles.css, and the included image folder with the game images.

Playing the game
1) Open the index.html file in the browser.
2) The game initiates with a player on the bottom of the screen as well as enemies (bugs) that run across the screen and loop back around.

4) Allowed movements - Use up, down, left, right arrow keys to move within the tiles across the game board. You cannot move out of bounds.
